# React Essentials – Your First React App 🚀

This project is part of a **React 19 tutorial series**, focused on setting up the development environment and creating your first React application using modern tooling.

## Development Environment

To get started with React, you only need two things:

- **Node.js** – Required to run JavaScript outside the browser and to use npm.
- **Code Editor** – Any editor works, but Visual Studio Code is commonly used.

Make sure Node.js is installed before continuing.

## Getting Started with React

There are multiple ways to start a React project, but for beginners, the recommended approach is:

- **Client-side React**
  - This has been the standard approach for over a decade.
  - It’s the best starting point for learning React fundamentals.
  - Other rendering strategies (SSR, SSG, etc.) are performance optimizations and should only be considered when they provide clear benefits.

## Creating a React App with Vite

In this course, the project is created using **Vite**, a fast and modern build tool.

### Create a new project

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
cd your-project-name
npm install
npm run dev
