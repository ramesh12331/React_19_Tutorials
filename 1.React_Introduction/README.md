## What is React?

**React** is a **JavaScript library** for building **web and mobile user interfaces**.

### Key Characteristics

- React is a **library**, not a framework
- Frameworks aim to handle everything in an application
- React focuses on **building user interfaces**
- It does **one thing extremely well**
- Routing, state management, and data fetching are handled via external libraries
- React has a **huge ecosystem** of third-party tools
- You only add what you need to your project

---

## Why Learn React?

- React is the **most popular UI library** in the world
- It dominates the **job market** and open-source ecosystem
- AI tools like **ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor**, and others excel at generating React code
- Used by companies of all sizes
- Strong long-term career relevance

---

## Component-Based Architecture

React follows a **component-based architecture**, meaning UIs are built using small, reusable pieces.

### Benefits

- Break complex UIs into **small, manageable components**
- Components are **reusable**
- Easy to compose components to build complex layouts
- Improves maintainability and scalability

### Example Layout Structure

+----------------------+
|        Header        |
+----------+-----------+
|  Aside   |   Main    |
|          |  Content  |
|          |           |
+----------+-----------+
|        Footer        |
+----------------------+


React integrates well with tools such as:
- React
- Next.js
- TypeScript

## Declarative UI

React is **declarative**, which means you describe *what* the UI should look like, and React handles *how* it updates.

### Simple Analogy

Think of ordering food at a restaurant:
- You tell the waiter what you want (a burger with fries)
- The waiter handles the preparation and delivery

Similarly, React updates the UI automatically when data changes.

---

## Flexible Integration

React makes **no assumptions** about the rest of your tech stack.

You can use React to:
- Enhance a small part of an existing website
- Build a complete single-page application
- Create mobile applications using **React Native**

---

## Prerequisites

Before learning React, you should be comfortable with:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Modern JavaScript (ES6+)**

### Recommended JavaScript Knowledge

- `let` and `const`
- Arrow functions
- Destructuring
- Modules (`import` / `export`)
- Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)

---

## What’s Next?
